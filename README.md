# Introduction
Do you need help converting your header-based codebase to C++20 modules?
importizer can help.

What can it do?
- Convert `#include` statements to `import` statement, as well as creating the GMF.
- Takes you on the way to modularizing your codebase by reducing lots of trivial work.
- **The only thing left to do is manually choosing what to export**.

importizer supports two modularization mode:
- **Complete**: You want to ditch header-based code altogether and embrace C++ modules. This is the default.
- **Transtitional**: You want to have both a header-based interface and a module-based one for backward compatibility, facilitating a gradual switch. You can opt in by specifing `[transitional]` in the setting file or `transitional` on the start of the command line.

Requirements:
- Code and options are valid UTF-8.
- Code is valid C++.

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

# Getting started
## Prebuilt executable
- Choose your OS.
- Download from the continuous tag. These are **debug** versions with sanitizers and no optimization.
- Download from other release tags. These are **release** versions with optimizations.

## Building from source
- Run:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/msqr1/importizer && cd importizer &&
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release &&
cmake --build . --config Release -j $(cmake -P ../nproc.cmake)
```
- The generated binary is called `importizer` in the current working directory.

## Usage
- To follow along, check the folders in examples folder. It has explanation and code after each step.

### 1. Before running
1. **Handle non-local macros and transitive includes** because they are incompatible with modules (see [Modules' side effects](#modules-side-effects)).
2. **Acquire the correct options for your project**, and add them into `importizer.toml` in the directory of the executable (or somewhere else and specify `-c`).
3. The TOML file is the recommended way, though you can specify command-line arguments to quickly test something out.

### 2. Run the program

### 3. After running
1. The output will be a list of file path, relative to `outDir` that need to go through manual exporting. You can redirect into a text file for easy viewing.
2. **Perform preamble sanity checks for all files**. Don't modify, refactor or export yet, you may need to rerun the program. Common error is forgetting a setting. If the program fails to generate valid code whatsoever, please file an issue.
3. Do depending on each mode:
    - Default:
      1. **Export**: Add `export` or `export {` and `}` around exported entities in the files outputted by the program.
      2. **Try compile the modularized project**.
    - Transitional (see a [mini demo](Examples/MiniTransitional.md)):
      1. **Try to compile using header**, you shouldn't have to change anything for this to work. If it doesn't, then importizer has an issue, please report it.
      2. **Export**: Add values of `mi_exportKeyword` or `mi_exportBlockBegin` and `mi_exportBlockEnd` around exported entities in the files outputted by the program.
      3. **Try compile using modules**, add `-D[value of mi_control]` when compiling every file to enable module mode.
4. **Refactor** (list will shorten over time):
    - **Refactor directives**: Importizer recreate the exact directive structure to ensure outside includes only happens in the original conditions. The minimizer try its best to shorten this structure, but it isn't context aware (eg. this define is not needed by this include).
    - **Refactor directives 2**: Since includes are moved up, they may leave unecessary directives at their original location.

## [Output example](Examples/Output.md)

# Behavior
- A file pair is defined as one header and one with the same basename (filename without extension) in the same directory. For example, `input/directory/file.cpp` and `input/directory/file.hpp`. The paired source must #include and defines everything declared in the paired header.
- importizer's behavior is undefined for a header-source pair and the source has a main function. Very rare in real code.
- Action by file type:

| File type | Paired             | Has `main()`       | Conversion                 | Must do manual export |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Header    |                    | N/A                | Module interface unit      | :heavy_check_mark:    |
| Header    | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A                | Module interface unit      | :heavy_check_mark:    |
| Source    |                    |                    | Module interface unit      | :heavy_check_mark:    |
| Source    | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | Module implementation unit |                       |
| Source    |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | Only include to import     |                       |

- Behavior of include path searching (similar concept to specifying `-I`):

| Type          | Action                                                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quoted        | 1. Relative to directory of the current file<br>2. Same as angle-bracket |
| Angle bracket | 1. Relative to each of `includePaths`                                    |

# Options
- Customize your behavior
- CLI options will override config file options.
- Paths are relative to the current working directory for CLI options, and relative to the config file for TOML options.
- General flags/options:

# Modules' side effects

## Transitive includes
- Modules are completely separate from each other. Transitive includes is not propogated across imported modules. Way(s) to remedy:
  - Include everything you use before modularization, so the tool would keep it automatically. You could use clangd with strict missing and unused include to help you.

## Non-local macros
- Modules, unlike headers, were explicitly designed to be encapsulated from macros and so they wouldn't leak them. Local macros only used in the file that defined them are OK. If a macro is defined in a header, and the header get modularized, it will only exist in that module. Way(s) to remedy:
  - Add the macro definition on the command line when compiling for the files that needed the macro (using `-D...`).
  - Refactor the macro definition into a separate header, `#include` that where the macro is needed, and add the new header to `ignoredHdrs`.
  - Add the macro-containing headers to the `ignoredHdrs` (recommended when the header's sole purpose is to provide macros).

# Developing

## Testing
- Add `-DTESTS=1` when configuring CMake.
- Build, then `cd [build root]/test`.
- Run `ctest`.
- If possible, file an issue for test(s) that failed.

## Precompiled headers
- Compile times are quite long, and it's only getting longer, so I made use of CMake precompiled headers. Some workarounds are required, so I prepared a setting.
- This can significantly reduce compile time by around 70%.
- Add `-DPCH=1` when configuring CMake.

## Contribution rules
- Use camelCase for variables and function names, class, type filenames are PascalCase
- Match the style of the code around you.
- Always use strict IWYU
- Max column width: 90, one or two past that is fine, but should not be abused.
- Put comment to denote what type after case label for variant switch.
- Keep options' order in the README, the option struct, and their value-checking order the same.
- To determine order for new options, optimize for the option struct size and follow chronological order.
- Off-by-default rule: All options must have a special "false" default value (eg. empty for arrays or `false` for boolean), or else must be converted to an std::optional if they solve a problem that may not be needed by users. Current ones are:
  - pragmaOnce
  - SOFComments
  - includeGuard
  - includePaths
  - ignoredHdrs
  - umbrellaHdrs
