# Introduction
Do you need help converting your header-based codebase to C++20 modules?
importizer can help.

Please note that the tool not very stable, I would love feedback for improvement before 1.0.0!

What does it do?
- Convert ```#include``` statements to ```import``` statement, as well as creating the GMF
- Takes you on the way to modularizing your codebase.
- **You would still have to manually choose what to export after running.**

importizer supports two modularization scheme:
- Complete modularization: You want to ditch header-based code altogether and embrace C++ modules. This is the default.
- Transtitional modularization: You want to have both a header-based interface and a module-based one for backward compatibility, facilitating a gradual switch. You can opt in by specifing ```[Transitional]``` in the setting file.

# Getting started
## Prebuilt executable
- There hasn't been an official release yet.
- You can try to download and run one of those for your OS from the continuous tag. Note that these are debug versions with sanitizers and others things turned on.

## Building from source
- Run:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/msqr1/importizer && cd importizer &&
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release &&
cmake --build . -j $(cmake -P ../nproc.cmake)
```
- The generated binary is called ```importizer``` in the current working directory

## Using the program
- Create a ```importizer.toml``` in the directory of the executable (or somewhere else and specify ```-c```), add some settings, and run the program.
- The output will be a list of file path, relative to ```outDir``` that need to go through manual exporting
-  For default mode, just add ```export``` (value of ```mi_exportKeyword``` for transitional mode) around the entities that you want to be exported.

# CLI
- Arguments will take precedence over those in the config file
- Paths are relative to the current working directory

# Behavior
- A file pair is defined as one header and one with the same basename (filename without extension) in the same directory. For example, ```input/directory/file.cpp``` and ```input/directory/file.hpp```. 
- importizer's behavior is undefined for a header-source pair and the source has a main function. This is extremely rare in real code, though.
- Action by file type:

| File type | Paired | Has ```main()``` | Conversion                 | Must do manual export |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Header    |        | N/A              | Module interface unit      | ✔                     |
| Header    | ✔      | N/A              | Module interface unit      | ✔                     |
| Source    |        |                  | Module interface unit      | ✔                     |
| Source    | ✔      |                  | Module implementation unit |                       |
| Source    |        | ✔                | Only include to import     |                       |

- Behavior of include path searching (similar concept to specifying ```-I```):

| Type          | Action                                                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quoted        | 1. Relative to directory of the current file<br>2. Same as angle-bracket |
| Angle bracket | 1. Relative to each of ```includePaths```                                |

# Macros
- Modules, unlike headers, were explicitly designed to be encapsulated from macros and so they wouldn't leak macros. If a macro is defined in a header, and the header get modularized, it will only exist in that module only. Some ways to remedy:
    - Add the macro definition on the command line when compiling for the files that needed the macro (using ```-D...```).
    - Refactor the macro definition into a separate header, ```#include``` that where the macro is needed, and add the new header to the ```ignoredHeaders```.
    - Add the macro-containing headers to the ```ignoredHeaders``` (their paired sources, if available will be treated as if they have a ```main()```)

# Some code style rule
- Max column width: 90
- Put comment to denote what type after case label for variant switch
- Keep settings' order in the README, the option struct, and their value-checking order the same.
- To determine order for new settings, optimize for the option struct size
