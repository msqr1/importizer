# 2.0.0 (in progress)
- Breaking: Change includeGuardPat to includeGuard.
- Breaking: Add and implement the off-by-default rule:
  - Include guards are no longer handled by default with a default regex.
  - Pragma once is no longer handled by default (new `pragmaOnce` setting).
- Maybe breaking: Default value of moduleInterfaceExt setting is now ".ixx" instead of ".cppm" to work by default on MSVC.
- Maybe breaking: `transitional` now needed to be specified at the start of the CLI instead of anywhere
- Add `SOFComments` setting to handle start-of-file comments (usually license).
- Split IncludePrevention test into include guard and pragma once tests.
- Remove condition generation for local include section in transitional mode. Modules build can't use macros from other file, so it's safe to assume regular build also don't.
- Update descriptions of includeGuard settings
- The minimizer is now able to remove empty `#el...` statements too. 
- Change the test name `Other` to `ModeIndependent`
- Make the minimizer and umbrella header tests ModeIndependent.
- CMake precompiled headers are now optional, opt in with the PCH option (like the TEST option).
- The argument parser is now Taywee/Args because it doesn't use std::any which can fail on Windows clang (#13)

# 1.1.0
- Add a shared directive section in transitional mode to shorten the preamble.
- CondMinimizer renamed to Minimizer that will also remove empty #define/#undef pair.
- Remove all *Action return from function. Perform the action directly and shorten code with a lambda.
- Add umbrella header support, converting includes to `export import` instead of `import`.
- Bump PCRE2 to 10.45.

# 1.0.1
- Fix includeGuardPat not matching the entire string to qualify as a guard.
- Fix CondMinimizer always skipping `#if` instead of only when its skippable.
- Fix raw string handling because the first `(` is not skipped over.
- Fix integer literals not being handled properly (I didn't think about them at all LOL).
- Fix CondMinimizer not handling nested `#if` (it looks for the earliest `#endif`) when skipping.
- Make condition hierarchy shorter by removing conditions for all imports.
- Bump libfmt to 11.1.3, PCRE2 to 10.45-RC1, Argparse to 3.2.

# 1.0.0
- First release.
